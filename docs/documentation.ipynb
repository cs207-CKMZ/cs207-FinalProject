    "### How to Use *AutoDiff_CKMZ*\n",
    "\n",
    "As our package will be distributed through PyPI, users can install it using `pip`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pip install AutoDiff_CKMZ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use forward mode of automatic differentiation, users should import the `AutoDiff` module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from AutoDiff_CKMZ.modules import AutoDiff\n",
    "```\n",
    "The AD object is instantiated in the following way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from AutoDiff_CKMZ.modules.AutoDiff import *\n",
    "# scalar\n",
    "obj1 = AutoDiff(2)\n",
    "# vector\n",
    "obj2 = [AutoDiff(2, [1,0]), AutoDiff(0, [0,1])]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Apart from basic operations (+, -, $\\ast$, /, $\\ast\\ast$), users can call elementary functions directly. These functions include the Trig functions (sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)), Inverse trig functions (arcsin(x), arccos(x), arctan(x)), Hyperbolic functions (sinh(x), cosh(x), tanh(x)), Logistic function (logistic(x)), Logarithms (log(x, base)), and the Square root (sqrt(x)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Demo:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# scalar\n",
    "f1 = lambda x: 2*x**2+1\n",

    "### Implementation\n",
    "This package implements an automatic differentiation class, which defines basic functions (e.g. addition) via operator overloading. The AD class will have name attributes for the function and derivative at a point. In addition, the AD class will have method attributes (defined using operator overloading) for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, etc. for instances of the class. The core data structures are floats and numpy arrays in order to hold the function value and derivative at a point. Elementary functions such as `sin` and `exp` will be defined outside of the AD class, relying on numpy functions such as `np.sin()`.\n",

    "### Future \n",
    "Our current implementation only implements the forward mode of automatic differentiation. A way to make this package even more widely applicable is to implement a reverse mode (back-propagation) as well. Including this capability in our package would enable our package to be used for an even wider range of applications, including machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have demostrated the utility of our package in an educational rollercoaster simulation using derivatives calculated by automatic differentiation. The rollercoaster simulation is handled through a GUI. There are many features which could be added to our rollercoaster simulation (improvements to the GUI, more complicated functions, etc). We could also apply our package to many other types of problems ranging from applied math (root-finding and optimization) to chemistry (quantum mechanics)."
