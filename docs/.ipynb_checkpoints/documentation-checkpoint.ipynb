    "All functions in ```AutoDiff.py``` contain documentation and doctests. Further tests are located in the ```tests``` directory, in ```test_fwd.py```. These tests are run whenever a push is made to the project repository through TravisCI and Coveralls. The badges for Coveralls and TravisCI are updated on our github repository README.md file, allowing easy confirmation of our package's working status.\n",
