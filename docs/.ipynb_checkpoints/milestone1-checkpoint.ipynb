    "### Introduction\n",
    "We are aiming to develop a software library for ***automatic differentiation*** (AD), which is a technique to numerically evaluate the derivative of a given function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivative is the key to many scientific and engineering problems, like numerical simulations and optimizations, so that the accuracy and speed of its evaluation are very important. Unlike symbolic or numerical differentiation, AD is much more computationally efficient with less errors and it is much faster at computing partial derivatives of functions with many inputs, which makes AD a superior method for derivative evaluations in large-scale scientific problems to other classic methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "**Decomposition into elementary functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the basic ideas behind AD is that given any complicated functions, we can decompose it into elementary ones. In other words, we can consider any function as a combination of elementary functions with elementary arithmetic operations, like addition and multiplication. The elementary functions include but are not limited to powers ($x^k$), roots ($\\\\sqrt{x}$), exponential functions ($e^{x}$), logarithms ($\\\\log{x}$), trigonometric functions ($\\\\sin{x}$), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "The realization of function decomposition is through computational graph. Each node represents an elementary arithmetic operation, or an elementary function, while each directed edge represents a path, or the flow of information. The computational graph can be used for both function value evaluation and derivative evaluation, where function value evalution only requires edge to deliver the value of the source node, while derivative evaluation also stores derivative on edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental to AD is the decomposition of differentials provided by the chain rule, which has the following formula：\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t},$$ where we have a function $f = f(x(t))$. By applying the chain rule repeatedly on the computational graph, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically and accurately with low computational complexity。"
