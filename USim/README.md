# USim - Simulation of motion along a given potential
## Group 18

USim is an educational tool meant to help students visualize motion along any potential function (e.g. a ball rolling along a roller coaster)

To use USim, run the command

```pip install USim```
Then, from python, run 
```Usim.main()```
This will open the GUI for the user to use.

If downloading from github, https://github.com/cs207-CKMZ/cs207-FinalProject/tree/master/USim, users can directly run 
```python main.py```
provided they have the right dependencies installed (outlined in requirements.txt)
