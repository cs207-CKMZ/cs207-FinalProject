# USim - Simulation of motion along a given potential
## Group 18

USim is an educational tool meant to help students visualize motion along any potential function (e.g. a ball rolling along a roller coaster)

USim is only available through our repository on Github: https://github.com/cs207-CKMZ/cs207-FinalProject
Simply download the USim folder, make sure you have all the dependencies from requirements.txt installed, move to the ```USim/USim/``` directory, and run
```python main.py```

This will open the GUI for the user to use.

To use our software, please make sure you have ```ffmpeg``` installed. For Mac OS's users, you can install it with `pip`:
```pip install ffmpeg```. Windows users please find instructions: https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-FFmpeg
