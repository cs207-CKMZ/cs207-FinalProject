The rollingball.py file is for physical simulation, and the animation.ipynb file is for animation.

Our work should be in the rollingball.py file, spefically in the rollingball.slope function, where different ways of calculating gradients are implemented. I noted 'implement AD here' and 'implement numerical estimate here'.

Note: you need to install FFmpeg to run animation.ipynb.
